# Bienvenue!

This is a starter kit to help you start a project for the CFRP hackathon quickly. Feel free to use as much or as little of these resources and ideas as you find useful. Some suggested first steps.

## 1. Get familiar with the data

1. [Read the listing of data tables and definitions](/data)
2. Explore
    1. [Install Postman])(https://www.getpostman.com)
    2. Import [this collection of API requests](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/75eb47f4dd961830b5b9).
    3. Experiment with the requests in the collection
3. Ask questions about how data are structured


## 2. Choose and define a project

### Look at the suggested project categories

- New tables/views/endpoints
- Search tools
- Visualizations
- Mashups/Linked data
- Documentation

On Friday afternoon, we'll have a chance to talk with researchers and other developers about possible project ideas. Choose one that interests you. Ask historians and developers any questions you have about how to proceed.

## 3. Hack!

### Fork this site

- Clone this repo locally; then:
- `git branch your-name/your-project`
- `cp project-template.html yourpage.html`
- If there is a request in Postman that serves your purposes, you can click "Generate Code" to get a copy/pasteable API client in your language of choice.

### Run this site locally

- If you have ruby 2.0+ installed:
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`
- `jekyll serve`

### Add your project to the site

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Created hackathon project"`
- `git push`
- Open a Pull request against the upstream repo.
